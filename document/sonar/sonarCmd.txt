Analyzing a Maven project consists of running a Maven goal: sonar:sonar in the directory where the pom.xml file sits.
way1:
    mvn clean verify sonar:sonar

# In some situation you may want to run sonar:sonar goal as a dedicated step. Be sure to use install as first step for multi-module projects
way2:
    mvn clean install
    mvn sonar:sonar

# Specify the version of sonar-maven-plugin instead of using the latest. See also 'How to Fix Version of Maven Plugin' below.
way3:
    mvn org.sonarsource.scanner.maven:sonar-maven-plugin:3.5.0.1254:sonar
